title: Info
---

When it comes to info requests, there are two alternatives. One for index level and one for database level.

## Index Info

Used to retrieve the stats of an index.

### Response

<ResponseField name="documentCount" type="number" required>
  The total number of documents in the database, that are ready to use.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="pendingDocumentCount" type="number" required>
  The number of documents in the database, that are still processing and not ready to use.
</ResponseField>

## Database Info

Alternatively, you can call `info` on the client itself, which will return information about the whole database:

### Response

<ResponseField name="documentCount" type="number" required>
  The total number of documents in the database, that are ready to use.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="pendingDocumentCount" type="number" required>
  The number of documents in the database, that is still processing and not ready to
  use.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="diskSize" type="number" required>
  The size of the database, in `b`.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="indexes" type="Record<string, Object>" required>
  A map of indexes to their information in the following format
  <Expandable defaultOpen="true">
    <ResponseField name="documentCount" type="number" required>
      The total number of documents in the index, that are ready to use.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="pendingDocumentCount" type="number" required>
      The number of documents in the index, that is still processing and not ready to
      use.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>
