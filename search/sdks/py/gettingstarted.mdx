`upstash-search` is a Python SDK for Upstash AI Search, enabling easier operations on Search Databases.

Using `upstash-search` you can:

- Perform AI-powered search queries with or without reranking.
- Upsert documents with metadata to an index.
- Fetch documents by their IDs.
- Delete documents from a database.
- Access database stats.
- Reset everything related to a database.

You can find the GitHub Repository [here](https://github.com/upstash/search-py). 

## Install

```bash
pip install upstash-search
```

## Usage

### Initializing the client

There are two pieces of configuration required to use the Upstash search client: a REST token and REST URL. These values can be passed using environment variables or in code through a configuration object. Find your configuration values in [the console dashboard](https://console.upstash.com/search).

#### Using environment variables

The environment variables used to configure the client are the following. You can follow [this guide](/search/overall/getstarted) to retrieve credentials.

```bash
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_URL="your_rest_url"
UPSTASH_SEARCH_REST_TOKEN="your_rest_token"
```

When these environment variables are set, the client constructor does not require any additional arguments.

```python
from upstash_search import Search

client = Search.from_env()
```

#### Using a configuration object

If you prefer to pass configuration in code, the constructor accepts a config object containing the `url` and `token` values. This
could be useful if your application needs to interact with multiple databases, each with a different configuration.

```python
from upstash_search import Search

client = Search(
    url="<SEARCH_INDEX_REST_URL>",
    token="<SEARCH_INDEX_REST_TOKEN>",
)
```

### Using an Index

The `Search` client is for operations that are about manipulating the Search database. With it, you can create indexes which is where you can upsert and search documents.

```python
index = client.index("films")

index.upsert(
    documents=[
        {
            "id": "movie-0",
            "content": {
                "title": "Star Wars",
                "overview": "Sci-fi space opera",
                "genre": "sci-fi",
                "category": "classic",
            },
            "metadata": {
                "poster": "https://poster.link/starwars.jpg",
            },
        },
    ],
)
```
