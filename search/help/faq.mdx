## Upload & Storage

**How can I upload a large dataset quickly?**

To upload large datasets efficiently, write a script that upserts documents in batches of 100.

**What is the maximum size or number of documents I can index?**

You can index an unlimited number of documents, though the entire database is capped at 50GB. Each document can contain up to 1,500 characters.

**How is storage calculated and charged?**

We charge based on the number of documents you store, not the storage size they take up.

## Search & Indexing

**Do you support full-text search?**

Yes, we support full-text search through special embedding models called sparse indexes that simulate full-text search capabilities within the vector space.

**What is the maximum number of search indexes I can create?**

You can create up to 10,000 indexes per database.

**How do I remove specific fields from an indexed document?**

You can simply upsert the same document without the unwanted fields. When you remove or rewrite records, their associated indexes are automatically removed if they are empty.

## Billing

**If I upload documents but don't perform searches, will I still be charged?**

Yes, you'll be charged for the number of documents you store, regardless of whether you perform searches on them.

**How are searches and document updates counted for billing?**

Both searches and document updates are counted as requests and charged at the same rate as document creation.

**If a single query returns multiple documents, how is that counted for billing?**

A query that returns multiple documents counts as a single request. If you enable reranking, you'll be charged based on the number of documents reranked, with pricing per 100-document units. For example, reranking 99 documents costs 1 unit, while reranking 101 documents costs 2 units.
